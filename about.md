Hello there, my name is Vivek Ramanujan. This is my personal website and blog. I am currently a university student studying towards a BS in Computer Science. This site shows my forrays into arbitrarily complex abstract puzzles and some more "real world" (overrated) examples. If you are looking to hire, check out my resume [here](../Vivek_Resume(2).pdf).
